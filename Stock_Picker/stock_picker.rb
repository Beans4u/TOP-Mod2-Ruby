# Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one 
# for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the 
# best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.
# 
# - You need to buy before you can sell
# - Pay attention to edge cases like when the lowest day is the last day 
#   or the highest day is the first day.

# should return: [1,4] for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
